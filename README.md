# KineticProject_Diffusion

## python code

In this project, we have calculated the time passed after the death by using the Ficks laws of diffusion. A Python program was developed to output results.

## MATLAB

In this code, I have plotted a graph in between time taken Vs. Extracellular initial concentration.
